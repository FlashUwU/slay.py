This is a Python SDK for Slay.one Real-Time API. We will be writting all the parts in Python first.
Later, we will make some parts in low-level language,
so it will be able to bind with SDK of any popular language.

Framework:
Core - basic api wrapper
Objects - Packet Data Structures, user uses it to filter packet-flow or enable operations
Models - Modules that developers can use
utils - just utils
entry point - everything in one interface (__init__.py)
